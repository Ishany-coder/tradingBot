# Model search — beat the S&P 60% of the time?

Metric: paired block-bootstrap (n=2000) win-rate of strategy total return vs SPY.
`win_rate (2020→)` = full window; `recent (2023→)` = rough out-of-sample check.
Target: **win-rate ≥ 60%**.

Honest caveat: a high win-rate with near-zero **IC** (information coefficient) is
magnitude/concentration in a bull market, not stock-picking skill. The recent
slice is the most useful generalization signal; even so, the 2020–2026 sample is
mostly a tech bull, so the bootstrap does not test a regime change.

## 2020 narrow-universe param sweep — OVERFITTING DEMO (do not deploy)

Sweeping `N_SECTORS` × `N_STOCKS_MAX` on the narrow 2020 universe (A/lambdarank):

| N_SECTORS | N_STOCKS | win-rate | edge | IC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 5 | **76%** ✅ | +30% | 0.0101 |
| 5 | 8 | 58% ❌ | −8% | 0.0101 |
| 5 | 12 | 11% ❌ | −66% | 0.0101 |
| 4 | 5 | 51% ❌ | −28% | 0.0101 |
| 3 | 5 | 37% ❌ | −49% | 0.0101 |

A single param cell (5×5) crosses 60%, but every neighbour fails and **IC is
identical (0.0101) across all cells** — i.e. no extra signal, just a lucky
concentration on one historical path. Classic overfit; NOT deployed.

## Conclusions

- **Winner: `sp500 / A (momentum-only) / lambdarank`** — beats S&P in 88% of
  resampled histories (73% on the recent 2023→ slice). Clears the 60% bar in and
  out of sample.
- The **narrow 2020 ETF-holdings universe cannot beat the S&P** with any model —
  it is a concentrated mega-cap slice that lagged. Breadth (full S&P 500) is what
  creates the edge.
- The **currently-live model (B / quality screen) does NOT meet the bar** (45%).
  Its quality screen drops too many names on this universe, cutting the
  momentum winners that drive the edge.
- IC stays ~0.004–0.016 everywhere — tiny. The win-rate is driven by the large
  compounded magnitude of a concentrated momentum book in the 2020–2024 bull,
  not by reliable per-name skill. Treat the live forward curve as the real test.
